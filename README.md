# Welcome to ukiyoGAN!

This Repo is an experiment in generating a GAN that creates ukiyo-e paintings.
The initial GAN architecture is taken from here: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html. The data used in this repo can be found here:

### Example images of the art presented herein:

To-do: 
- this paper seems to provide an interesting pipeline for style transfer: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12892.pdf
